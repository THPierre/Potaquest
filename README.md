# Potaquest
Potaquest is a school project made on Unity and running on Android.

This project was made during the first semester of my second year of degree, and i was in charge of programming.
the team was composed of 4 people, featuring one game designer, one programmer(myself), and two game artists/animators.

I made all the code, from gameplay to user interface, and i was also in charge of the quality control of the assets in the project.
